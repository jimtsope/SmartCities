# SmartCities


The Smart City Energy Consumption Analysis and Forecasting scenario aims to analyze energy use patterns in various infrastructures within the SC, correlated with weather conditions such as temperature and humidity. So, to analyze the patterns, appropriate data is collected from Kaggle.com, selecting various data and metrics for the city of LA with a time period indicative of 7/2015 to 9/2020 (five years). This dataset includes a variety of attributes including temperature, humidity, occupancy, HVAC and lighting usage, renewable energy contributions, and more. This file was chosen as it was more targeted in terms of features without having to do a lot of cleanup of unnecessary data. The archive incorporates a variety of features at various timestamps, offering a comprehensive exploration of simulated environments. Each timestamp provides a snapshot of a hypothetical environment, allowing for in-depth analysis and modeling of energy consumption behaviors. A compressed folder is created with the two downloaded files and then the appropriate ones are selected libraries for using python through jupyter notebook.
